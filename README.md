SEAR Data Capture

RANDOM NOTES: [Stuff learned making this project, to organize later)
ALWAYS double check that is the header search paths match where the frameworks are!
This is second time I have been burned but trying to put all the frameworks into one folder, and then XCode is super dumb and acts like it can't find them.
