		// In order to receive these messages on a remote machine, you can, for instance, use the netcat command-line utility (available by default on Mac OS X).

		// From Occipital

		// Sadly, iOS 9.2+ introduced unexpected behavior: every time a Structure Sensor is plugged in to iOS, iOS will launch all Structure-related apps in the background.
		// The apps will not be visible to the user.
		// This can cause problems since Structure SDK apps typically ask the user for permission to use the camera when launched.
		// This leads to the user's first experience with a Structure SDK app being:
		//     1.  Download Structure SDK apps from App Store.
		//     2.  Plug in Structure Sensor to iPad.
		//     3.  Get bombarded with "X app wants to use the Camera" notifications from every installed Structure SDK app.
		// Each app has to deal with this problem in its own way.
		// In the Structure SDK, sample apps peacefully exit without causing a crash report.
		// This also has other benefits, such as not using memory.
		// Note that Structure SDK does not support connecting to Structure Sensor if the app is in the background.
		//
		// Occipital's Obj-C version of the suggested code:
		//
		//if ([UIApplication sharedApplication].applicationState == UIApplicationStateBackground)
		//{
		//    NSLog(@"iOS launched %@ in the background. This app is not designed to be launched in the background, so it will exit peacefully.",
		//           [[NSBundle mainBundle] objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@"CFBundleDisplayName"]
		//    );
		//    exit(0);
		//}
		//
		// Now my Swift Version
		
		//
		
		if ( UIApplication.shared.applicationState == UIApplication.State.background )
		{
			NSLog( "SEAR-RL launched %@ in the background." )
			NSLog( "This app is not designed to be launched in the background, so it will exit peacefully." )
			exit( 0 )
		}
